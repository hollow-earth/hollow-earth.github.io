					 		<!--My username does not come from the conspiracy theory, but rather from the game <a href="https://www.stygiansoftware.com/underrail/index.html">
							UnderRail</a>, where the name is taken from the <a href="https://www.stygiansoftware.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hollow_Earth">
							<i>Hollow Earth complex</i></a>.--> I enjoy both low- and high-level programming, as they both offer different optimization challenges with different
							constraints and requirements - especially embedded systems. My background in physics gives me an unquenchable thirst for problem solving, 
							which is very fortunate considering the industry I'm a part of. I love being able to thinker on both hardware and software at once, as it gives
							me a sense of truly creating something from the ground up.

									<h2>Chaosball (2021)</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Chaosball was a game I developed for the McGill Gamejam 2021 in 45 hours along with 
										<a href="https://portfolio.okaya.dev/" target="_blank">O. Kaya</a> and <a href="https://roseduf.itch.io/" target="_blank">RoseDuf</a>. 
										This 3D singleplayer game had the theme "unintended consequences" and won 3rd place overall. I wrote a decent chunk of the music, 
										made the UI and worked on some of the code. I also wrote the description, which still stands on itch.io to this day: 
									</p>
									<blockquote style="font-size: 0.8em">
										Chaosball is simple but enjoyable game where the premise is quite simple: there are crates 
										you have to protect; let them disappear and you will disappear as well. Fortunately, you have your trusty Powderizer-5874 
										by your side to help you fight against this unusual threat presented in the form of flying spheres.
										Inspired by games such as "Bubble Trouble" and "Antichamber"
									</blockquote>
									<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
										This project was my first introduction to the world of game jams. It was a unique experience that I thoroughly enjoyed, despite the
										lack of sleep that came with it. After all, why would I attempt a gamejam if I was not ready to sacrifice some sleep? This project
										uses <b>C#/Unity Game Engine</b>.

									<h2>Scandium (2022)</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Scandium was a project I undertoook in 2022 while I was still looking for a job for the summer. 
										Instead of doing nothing while waiting for callbacks, I decided, hey, why not practice my C++ and learn something new? 
										And thus, I started learning Vulkan and made barebones game engine from scratch. The result: I learned 
										about the graphics pipeline and how it works "under the hood", I got a new major linear algebra refresher along with new insights, 
										more advanced C++ techniques and better memory management patterns, and a high-quality 60 FPS rotating cube. Of course, 
										adding sprites and 3D models would be relatively easy with tinyobjloader and such, but manually creating vertices is more fun
										and challenging. This project uses <b>GLM, C++, GLSL, and Vulkan</b>.
										
										<br /><br /> I chose the name "scandium" for a simple reason: the chemical symbol is Sc, which corresponds to 
										my initials.

									<h2>Handwritten LaTeX (2022)</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 0.8em">
										In 2021, I was still studying for my physics degree at McGill. I initially tried taking notes digitally, both handwritten and
										typed, but nothing beat paper when it comes to helping me remember stuff. The main issue was portability: moving paper around can
										be a real pain sometimes. So I thought, why not digitize them first and then turn them into LaTeX so I can rearrange my notes? Armed with
										Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV2 and some free time, I first built a script that would take digitized images, apply image processing in order
										to get rid of imperfections, random scan lines and paper lines, and then apply bounding boxes to each character. These characters were
										then fed to the AI model which was trained on a few hundred handwritten characters from my own handwriting (to the left is an example).
										The LaTeX code was then output to the GUI. While the confidence wasn't exceptional (~80%), it was a great learning experience that made me
										understand how machine learning works "under the hood" through the use of linear algebra. It would've have been possible to end up with better latin
										character recognition if I had used the MNIST database and other such sets. This project uses <b>Python, TensorFlow, opencv2,
										and Numpy</b>.

									<h2>Musclee (2023)</h2>
									<p style="font-size: 0.8em">Musclee was a workout tracking website we developed in 24 hours (well, closer to 12) during the hackathon
										McHacks 2023 with a friend. We learned <i>Flask</i> in a very short time and managed to set up a quick frontend for the website.
										While the backend was working great and had basic documentation, the frontend ended up not being worked on very much, due to
										some teammates leaving the team halfway through the project and not coming back the following day. Despite not winning anything,
										the project taught me a lot about databases (notably the usage of sqlite3 and by extension MySQL) and backend coding. The website
										could dynamically generate progression graphs for the user as well as show the raw data that the user entered. Regardless,
										McHacks2023 managed to land me an interview at a great organization due to me solving their <i>crackme</i> challenge. This project
										uses <b>Python, Flask, sqlite3, requests, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript</b>.
