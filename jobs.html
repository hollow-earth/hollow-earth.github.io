							<h1 class="major">My Relationship with the Job Market</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/troll.gif" alt="" />
							</span>Hello there. First and foremost, <i>thank you for scrolling down this far and taking interest in my profile.</i>
							The <b>truth is, I've been looking for a software development job for a while now</b>. Day after day, rejection after rejection,
							I keep testing my luck and hoping to get a junior software development position somewhere that will value and appreciate
							my skill set. <br /><br />
							
							Before 2021, I was working student jobs. You know the type. Nothing that requires a ton of experience. In 2021, I worked two jobs in order
							to get enough money to be able to move to Montreal and study there instead going to Universit√© Laval, as McGill is more known across Canada.
							The first job was the same one I've had since 2016 while the second was a support technician job in electronics/solar power. I've done my 
							fair share of pratical electronics and solar system design but then I had to move to Montreal for my studies.<br /><br />

							In 2022, I was interviewed for a job at a certain company for Python development - good salary, interesting responsabilities, 
							and so on. I was actually interested, but they wanted me to drop my degree and work with them fulltime, which is 
							something I simply couldn't do at the time. I was still trying to get my minor in chemistry, but ended up 
							dropping it due to time constraints and I ended up replacing it with several computer science classes and projects in order to obtain 
							a partial computer science minor. <br /><br />
							
							In late 2022 and early 2023, 
							I had the opportunity to work with a fantastic group at McGill working on the ALBATROS (Array of Long Baseline Antennas for 
							Taking Radio Observations from the Sub-antarctic/Seventy-ninth parallel) under professor <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/" target="_blank">
							Cynthia Chiang</a>. I even <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/theses/careau.pdf" target="_blank">wrote a short paper</a> 
							about what I did there. In all honesty, I regret not being able to help them more, but unfortunately I'm no longer in Montreal 
							(for now, at least). You can read more about it <a href="research.html">here</a>.<br /><br />

							Of course, during all this time, I've worked a lot on my software development skills, especially once I realized that despite physics research
							being quite interesting, <i>it was not something I could see myself working in for 40+ years.</i> I truly enjoyed ALBATROS and cosmology research, but I 
							do not believe I could do this forever. Unfortunately by then it was essentially too late to change my major, I was only one semester away from 
							graduation. I couldn't transfer to mechanical engineering either, so <b>I turned to the next thing I know best: software</b>. Last year, I applied 
							to several internships, without any success.
