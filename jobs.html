							<h1 class="major">My Relationship with the Job Market</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/troll.gif" alt="" />
							</span>Hello there. First and foremost, <i>thank you for scrolling down this far and taking interest in my profile.</i>
							The <b>truth is, I've been looking for a software development job for a while now</b>. Day after day, rejection after rejection,
							I keep testing my luck and hoping to get a junior software development position somewhere that will value and appreciate
							my skill set.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								I've been applying to several jobs a day for the last few months, with no success, all while working a fulltime job in a field that has
								no correlation with my field of study whatsoever. The current record is held by a video game company which rejected me in a mere <b>35 minutes</b>
								for the role of "physics gameplay programmer", which I thought was basically my field of speciality, combining both the knowledge of physics and
								software development. My interview count is currently a mere <b>2 interviews</b>. I rarely make it past the pre-screening stage, because 
								I imagine that human resources do not like seeing my resume pop up on their computer with the wrong major.
							</p>

							<p>
								When I initially applied to McGill to major in physics, I didn't really consider the job market too much. I was following my dreams
								and I expected to get a masters in astrophysics, which was my passion. But due to a large combination of factors, I ended up on a different
								path. I need to work with my hands and create things, not just... write on paper 24/7. Therefore the path of engineering might have been
								better suited for me, but engineering requires certifications that are currently out of my reach due to financial reasons. As such, software
								is the next best thing for me: I'll still end up creating something with my own hands, after all.
							</p>

							<p>
								Before 2021, I was working student jobs. You know the type. Nothing that requires a ton of experience. In 2021, I worked two jobs in order
								to get enough money to be able to move to Montreal and study there instead going to Universit√© Laval, as McGill is more known across Canada.
								The first job was the same one I've had since 2016 while the second was a support technician job in electronics/solar power. I've done my 
								fair share of pratical electronics and solar system design but then I had to move to Montreal for my studies.
							</p>

							<p>
								In 2022, I was interviewed for a job at a certain company for Python development - good salary, interesting responsabilities, 
								and so on. I was actually interested, but they wanted me to drop my degree and work with them fulltime, which is 
								something I simply couldn't do at the time. I was still trying to get my minor in chemistry, but ended up 
								dropping it due to time constraints and I ended up replacing it with several computer science classes and projects in order to obtain 
								a partial computer science minor. I also applied to certain internships, without success. I understand that tech is a very competitive market,
								but... It's just hard you know? I suppose I should have picked a better time for graduating.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								In late 2022 and early 2023, 
								I had the opportunity to work with a fantastic group at McGill working on the ALBATROS (Array of Long Baseline Antennas for 
								Taking Radio Observations from the Sub-antarctic/Seventy-ninth parallel) under professor <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/" target="_blank">
								Cynthia Chiang</a>. I even <a href="https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~chiang/theses/careau.pdf" target="_blank">wrote a short paper</a> 
								about what I did there. In all honesty, I regret not being able to help them more, but unfortunately I'm no longer in Montreal 
								(for now, at least). You can read more about it <a href="research.html">here</a>.
							</p>

							<!--<p>
								Of course, during all this time, I've worked a lot on my software development skills, especially once I realized that despite physics research
								being quite interesting, <i>it was not something I could see myself working in for 40+ years.</i> I truly enjoyed ALBATROS and cosmology research, but I 
								do not believe I could do this forever. Unfortunately by then it was essentially too late to change my major, I was only one semester away from 
								graduation. I couldn't transfer to mechanical engineering either, so <b>I turned to the next thing I know best: software</b>. Last year, I applied 
								to several internships, without any success.

							<p>
								Just a reminder of how ridiculous this whole ordeal is, I've decided to track the number of jobs I've applied to since the first of October.
								Of course, I've applied to more than that, but I didn't focus on keeping track. I thought finding a job would be much less harder than this.
								I really focus on entry-level positions where I meet at least half the requirements, though occasionally I will apply to jobs that ask for 5+
								years simply because I match all the other requirements, save for the years of experience. Even then, most the junior positions want "3+ years",
								but realistically, most people applying to these jobs are recent graduates as well.
